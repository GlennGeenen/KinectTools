KinectTools
===========

Kinect Tools will consist of a number of small applications used to demonstrate / play around with the Kinect 4 Windows 2 Controller.

===========

v0.1

KinectWheel is an application that lets you use the Kinect like a racing wheel. It translates Kinect movement into Keyboard input. You need to have the KinectService for K4W 2 running.

It currently fires following keys:
W: forward
S: brake / reverse
A: left
D: right

These keys are used to not interfere with in game menus.

You put your arms in front of yourself as if you're holding a wheel. Holding it close will brake or reverse, holding it further in front of you will accelerate. You steer as with a normal wheel.

===========

v0.2

Added vJoy support.
http://vjoystick.sourceforge.net

When you start in vJoy mode the gestures will be translated to JoyStick input over the X and Y axis.

===========

Future Features:
- Allow you to configure the keys
- Simulate to be a gamepad (xbox controller)
